Hi Stefan

missed your mail to the list. I was actually not member of the list.
Stupid me.

Well, I expected that :-)

I just added a short description of the .inc.src files to the README in the SVN.

No. Thats it. The build scripts will do the remaining work. Just call make 
in the top level dir and you will get a Eagle3D directory structure in build/eagle3d
